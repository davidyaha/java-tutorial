I have inserted all of your code into a file called ChatServer.java

Some notes:

1. I wanted you to use ArrayList class. (see comments)
2. System.out.print() -> this method does not return any value so you cannot write it after return statement.
in your code you should have just returned the string of the error.
3. no need for do on if.
4. read about Exceptions on java
5. you are right about your question of the index. 
trying to get a cell that is not in the array's range will get your program to be terminated because of an error. 
unless you handle the error. for more information about it, read about Exceptions.
6. The solution that i wrote has a couple of bugs. try to find and fix them. read about debugging in order to do it.

Regardless, that was a pretty good start. keep at it.
The next part is already on the server.

Good luck,
David
